I made a few modifications to the one I sent earlier, 
instead of filling the form via Google forms we 
can fill the form locally and save in database and CSV file as wel, 
then run the print script to generate the printable format.

The feature of running the script for a CSV file from Google forms 
is still available on the platform.
The readme file in the root directory has detailed information on how it should be run.

When we're ready to generate ID cards, we download the csv format of the response sheet of the Google form,
or copy the reg.csv file in this directory,
then rename as accf.csv and replace the one in "/src" folder with this new one.

Then open the index.php file, to generate cards.
I created several frames as could be viewed in the /frames directory, corrections could 
also be made to the frame before generating the id cards. The frame in use is frame.png
